# TODO: Implement Registration Page with Simple REST API Simulation

- [x] Create register.html: New registration page with form for username, password, confirm password, styled like login.html, with link back to login.
- [x] Create register.js: Handle registration form submission, validate inputs, simulate POST API by storing user in localStorage, redirect to login on success.
- [x] Edit login.html: Add link to register.html ("Don't have an account? Register here").
- [x] Edit login.js: Update login logic to check against registered users in localStorage; if no users, fall back to hardcoded creds or show message.
